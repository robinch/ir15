2 Davis_Life_Magazine 1 // difficult
This mentions the rowing team and even links to a page with more information
But does not contain any other information about rowing team

2 UC_Davis_Budget_Cuts 1 // Difficult
It is information about rowing team but it's just mentioned. And the information is about 5 years old so it might not be
relevant anymore

2 Protests 1 // difficult
The same as above



3 Bats 2 // difficult
this could be a 1 or a 2 because this points to a tourist attraction and do explains it
but that is the only thing in the document that does contain information of tourist attractions.
The rest is about rats

3 Central_Coast 3 // difficult
This doesn't mention the word tourist attraction alot but it's really relevant if you are looking
for stuff to do in central coast

3 Northern_California 3 // difficult
same as above but it actually uses the words attractions
