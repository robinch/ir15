Query: historical monuments davis
no hits.

might be to specific.
Let's try to only use historical monuments instead because the search done in davis wiki

Query: historical monuments
no hits.

let's right the words in dictionary form

Query: historic monument
no hits.

let's just try monument

Query: monuments

AliPezeshkpour 0

Street_Name_Themes 2 // links to monuments etc

precision = 1/2

we need to add more information to the query
bcause just searching for monument also makes us get all other meaning of monument that we don't want.


We can try to use a synonym

Query: memorial

MANY HITS!!! (464)

lets tweak it because memorial can means many different things also.
Like having a memorial for some dead person, or some prices that's given in a dead persons name.

precision = 4/17

still not good enough but best so far

let's try to add a word that might be in the text

Query: honoring memorial davis

Davis_Cemetery 1
Davis_Cemetery_Veterans_Marker 2
Harmony_in_Our_Lives_Award 0
Memorials 3 (over 9000!)
Pence_Gallery 1
The_Davis_Chorale 0

precision 4/6 = 2/3

This gave some good results. The Memorial wiki site gave a list of many memorials and is exactly what we are
after. So let's try to narrow it down.

By looking at the Memorials page we can see that they have a lot of benches there.
So we could actually search for memorial benches. Then we would get the memorial page + the benches. and get a lot if
hits but I think it's better to just get a few quality search results.

But let's try add place to the query. So that we get the locations

Query: honoring memorial davis place

Davis_Cemetery 1
Memorials 3
Pence_Gallery 1

precision 3/3 = 1

This gave very good results. The cemetary and gallery mentions memorial that are honoring people or veterans.
And the Memorial hit is really good and answers the question "Are there any historical monuments in Davis?"
The answer is yes!



query: memorial honoring davis town

Memorials 3

Precision 1/1 = 1

This only gives the link collection of memorials in davis. It's answers the questions directly.
This is also a query that people might search for








Why can we not simply set the query to be the entire information need description?

There are several words that will not appear in the results
"are" ,"there", "any", "in"

So we should actually filter som of these words before 

Are there any historical monuments in Davis?
