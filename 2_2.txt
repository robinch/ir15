Why do we use a union query here, but an intersection query in Assignment 1?

The central concept here is the vector model for query-document similarity. You should 
be able to explain this concept using pen and paper, and discuss how variations in tf 
representation (such as log(1+tf)) and document length representation (such as 
Euclidean length, or sqrt(#words)) affect the cosine similarity measure.
