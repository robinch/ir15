Question
Why do we use a union query here, but an intersection query in Assignment 1?

Answer
There can be words that are not essential in the query.
Queries like "How do you {thing}" where the how do you part can be ommited but the {thing} is essential.



The central concept here is the vector model for query-document similarity. You should 
be able to explain this concept using pen and paper, and discuss how variations in tf 
representation (such as log(1+tf)) and document length representation (such as 
Euclidean length, or sqrt(#words)) affect the cosine similarity measure.


tf = term frequency
idf = inverse document frequency


tf = #words in this document

idf = ln(N/df), N = #totalNumberOfDocs, df =
