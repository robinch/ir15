The highest ranked document has the title ”Davis”, while the document ranked 50 has the 
title ”Interpreting User Statistics”. Does this pagerank ordering seem reasonable? Why?

Yes. The page rank is built on the concepts of links. Having many pages linking to a page gives
it a higher ranking. Many pages will either link to general pages such as Davis or pages about the wiki
such as photo request or statistical pages.

They are usually general pages with many links. Or meta pages for the wiki. 


Look up the titles of some other documents with high rank. What is the trend with 
decreasing pagerank?

They get more and more specific.
