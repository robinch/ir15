First we need a baseline to compare to.

Do a combined, ranked search on these following queries.

skiing trip
university rowing team
tourist attractions

Write down the recall and precision at 10 for each query.

Now choose 2 relevant documents and remember which you chose.

We will now see how the recall and precision are effected by "a" and "b"

We will use the default values, lower values and higher values.
a = {0.6, 1, 1.3}, b = {0.5, 7.5, 1.3}. (middle values are the default).
And use the same 2 relevant documents.

And now do new seaches with the following values:
a = 0.6, try all "b" values
a = 1, try all "b" values
a = 1.3, try all "b" values

There will be 9 searches all together

Write down the recall and precision at 10 for all these cases.
Now create one graph for each "a" value and see how the recall and precision at 10 changes depending on the "b" value

Compare these to the baseline.

Anything interesting?
